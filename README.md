## User Experience

I employed the design thinking process to create a website with only essential information, resulting in easy navigation for users.

Throughout the entire development process, I followed the Agile methodology, which involved careful planning and continuous improvement until the final product was completed. To stay organized and on track, I made use of a GitHub project and a [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/Kattis91/projects/4). For more details on the User Stories, please refer to the subsection below â‡©.

### Strategy

All my User Stories can be found [here](https://github.com/Kattis91/with-travel-in-mind/issues).

During the planning process, the project was divided into 39 User Stories, each belonging to an Epic and labeled according to MoSCoW Prioritization, indicating the importance of the feature. 

To manage and structure the workload, the User Stories were grouped into three iterations. Each iteration was carefully planned to ensure that no more than 60% of the must-have User Stories were included. 

During the development, I had to make some adjustments to the plan and rearrange some items to achieve better workflow. However, I was still able to maintain control of the situation and ensure that everything was completed on time.

All the User Stories include Acceptance Criteria and Tasks.

Once a User Story was completed, it was marked as closed to keep track of the progress.

#### Key Project Goal

The goal is to create a community platform that connects travelers and allows them to share their experiences and the excitement of discovering new destinations. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and fosters a sense of community among travelers. Everybody should feel welcome!

#### Target Audience

Are you an experienced traveler and have lots to share? Feel free to share your treasures with others here.
Or are you busy with other things right now and only have travel in mind?
Join the community and gain inspiration for your upcoming travels. 

### Structure

The website is organized into several sections, including some that are only available to logged-in users. All visitors can view detailed information about each post. However, logged-in users have additional privileges, such as publishing, editing, and deleting their own posts, as well as interacting with other posts by liking, bookmarking, and commenting on them. The website is designed to facilitate easy searches for posts by allowing users to search by post title or author username or by sorting posts by region. Logged-in users can even sort posts by going to the page with only bookmarked posts or posts by people they follow or have in their favorite list.

For more detailed information about mentioned features and all the other features see section [Existing Features](#existing-features).

## Reusable Components

Several reusable React components were created to reduce code duplication.

**`Asset.js`**

The asset component is utilized throughout the site to display a loading spinner from react-bootstrap while content is being processed.
The component is used on the following pages:

- ExplorerPage.js
- PopularExplorers.js
- PopularPosts.js
- PostCreateForm.js
- PostDetail.js
- PostsPage.js

**`Avatar.js`**

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx0imlozl/image/upload/v1701030956/avatar_ya1mft.png)

This component displays the user's profile image, which can be customized or set to the default image. The default height is set to 55. The component is used on the following pages:

- Comment.js
- CommentCreateForm.js
- Explorer.js
- Post.js

**`EditDeleteDropdown.js`**

 The component is accessed for editing or deleting posts and comments, and for updating the explorer profile. 

**`ModalDeleteConfirmation.js`**

To enhance the defensive design of the website, I implemented a validation check to ensure that data is not deleted accidentally. To achieve this, I have created a modal component that prompts the user to confirm their choice before deleting data from the site. The modal component is triggered when the user clicks on the delete icon in the hamburger menu (EditDeleteDropdown component) for a post or a comment. This component verifies the type of data that the user intends to delete and customizes the confirmation message accordingly. Once the user clicks on the "Yes!" button, the corresponding handleDelete function is executed, and the data is permanently removed from the site.

**When choosing to delete a post:**

**When choosing to delete a comment:**

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx0imlozl/image/upload/v1700671870/comment-delete-confirmation_lg2xax.png)


**`Navbar.js`**

The nav bar component is a crucial element of the website that manages the main site navigation menu. It incorporates a function to sign out the user. The icons are sorted into two groups, one for logged-out users and the other for logged-in users. The appropriate icons are displayed based on whether the user is authenticated or not.

## Testing and Validation

Detailed testing of the site can be found at [TESTING.md](TESTING.md). 

Testing includes following:

- Validator testing
- Responsivness & Browser Compability Testing
- Manual Testing
- Testing of User Stories

## Fixed Bugs

- NavBar logged-in and logged-out view failed upon signing in. The user was directed to the homepage, but the navbar showed the links for logged out users.

  The error message displayed in the console: 
  
  `failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (unauthorized)` 
  
  API's message: `Authentication credentials were not provided`

  **Fix:**
    - Downgrade dj-rest-auth version in the API: 
      ````
      pip3 install dj-rest-auth==2.1.9
      `````
    - Git add | git commit | git push
    - Deploy on Heroku.
    - See below.

- Deployment failed due to following ImportError:

  `ImportError: allauth needs to be added to INSTALLED_APPS`

  **Fix:**
    - Downgrade django-allauth version in the API: 
      ````
      pip3 install django-allauth==0.54.0
      ````
    - Git add | git commit | git push
    - Deploy on Heroku.

  Source: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76969410/importerror-allauth-needs-to-be-added-to-installed-apps)

- "Favorites" in the Navbar showed the list of all posts (however none of those posts have been added to the favorite list). 

  **Fix:** Add the missing `owner__favorited__owner__explorer` into **filterset_fields** in the posts views in the Back-End [with-travel-in-mind-api](https://github.com/Kattis91/with-travel-in-mind-api).

- `Could not find a declaration file for module 'react-router-dom'` message was displayed when I was trying to import { NavLink }.

  My preview didn't show anything at all.

  **Fix:** install types: `npm install --save @types/react-router`

- When I was trying to pre-populate my PostEditForm and clicked on the "edit" icon for the post I had created, I was taken to the edit page but that was not pre-populated. Moreover, after a just a second, I was redirected to the homepage (like a user who is not an owner should be).

  **Fix:** Add the missing return statement (`return request.user == obj.owner`) to the get_is_ownwer method in posts serilaizers.py in the Back-End.
    
    ````
    def get_is_owner(self, obj):
        request = self.context['request']
        return request.user == obj.owner
    ````

- When I tried to like a comment, the number of likes displayed as "NaN" instead of an actual number. The same happened when I tried to remove the like. 

  **Fix**: After checking everything a bunch of times, I got support from Oisin on the Tutor Assistance who noticed that the annotate method in the comment views was missing. Adding commentlikes_count to the queryset and importing **Count** from _django.db.models_ solved the issue.

    ````
    queryset = Comment.objects.annotate(
          commentlikes_count=Count('commentlikes', distinct=True)
    )
    ````

- It has been identified that the React Bootstrap mobile Navbar has an issue where the Collapse burger menu does not automatically close after a selection is made. I tried using the solution suggested in the CI Moments walkthrough by creating the useClickOutsideToggle.js component. However, I found that this solution only works for a simple list of links and not for additional dropdown menus. I have three links in the dropdown menu, and I couldn't reach them because the navbar closed automatically when clicking on the dropdown header.

  My first solution was to delete UseClickOutsideToggle.js and toggle the links manually by using onClick event.

  ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx0imlozl/image/upload/v1701010028/on-click_ikhpz5.png)

  However, it caused another issue, which was poor cooperation with the "Add Post" link.
  When the user clicked on the "Add Post" link, the entire hamburger menu opened and was over the "Add Post" form.
  ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx0imlozl/image/upload/v1701009310/hamburger-menu-bug_qkfce9.png)

  The menu toggled again when the user clicked the "Add Post" link one more time or when it was clicked after first opening the hamburger menu, but it was a poor user experience.

  **Fix:** Move the "Add Post" link to loggedInIcons so it ends up in the hamburger menu along with the other links. The burger menu only closes when some link is clicked; clicking outside the menu does not close it, but I find this behavior acceptable, at least for now.

- If the user did not refresh the page, the search filter was not reset. I considered it a poor user experience because if the user didn't know they needed to refresh the page, they could be confused and think that the site had hanged. Additionally, if the user navigated to some of feed pages (Bookmarks | Following | Favorites) without refreshing the page beforehand, the previous search parameters would carry over and restrict the results. For instance, if the user performed a search for posts tagged with the region "Africa" and then proceeded to the bookmarks page, they would only be able to view bookmarked posts that belonged to the selected region.

  **Fix:**

  - Create the clearFilters function:
  
    ![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dx0imlozl/image/upload/v1701099827/createFilters_bwkhyx.png)

  - Add a ternary condition to call the function and display "Reset your search filter" button only on region selection or keyword input.
