# With Travel In Mind

## Fixed Bugs

- NavBar logged-in and logged-out view failed upon signing in. The user was directed to the homepage, but the navbar showed the links for logged out users.

  The error message displayed in the console: 
  
  `failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (unauthorized)` 
  
  API's message: `Authentication credentials were not provided`

  - **Fix:**
    - Downgrade dj-rest-auth version in the API: 
      ````
      pip3 install dj-rest-auth==2.1.9
      `````
    - Git add | git commit | git push
    - Deploy on Heroku.
    - See below.

- Deployment failed due to following ImportError:

  `ImportError: allauth needs to be added to INSTALLED_APPS`

  - **Fix:**
    - Downgrade django-allauth version in the API: 
      ````
      pip3 install django-allauth==0.54.0
      ````
    - Git add | git commit | git push
    - Deploy on Heroku.

- "Favorites" in the Navbar showed the list of all posts (however none of those posts have been added to the favorite list). 

  - **Fix:** Add the missing `owner__favorited__owner__explorer` into **filterset_fields** in the posts views in the Back-End [with-travel-in-mind-api](https://github.com/Kattis91/with-travel-in-mind-api).

- `Could not find a declaration file for module 'react-router-dom'` message was displayed when I was trying to import { NavLink }.

  My preview didn't show anything at all.

  - **Fix:** install types: `npm install --save @types/react-router`

- When I was trying to pre-populate my PostEditForm and clicked on the "edit" icon for the post I had created, I was taken to the edit page but that was not pre-populated. Moreover, after a just a second, I was redirected to the homepage (like a user who is not an owner should be).

  - **Fix:** Add the missing return statement (`return request.user == obj.owner`) to the get_is_ownwer method in posts serilaizers.py in the Back-End.
    
    ````
    def get_is_owner(self, obj):
        request = self.context['request']
        return request.user == obj.owner
    ````
