### JavaScript

Validator: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

All JavaScript files in the "With Travel In Mind" project have been run through the JavaScript ESLinter. 

The following errors were corrected:

- **`'React' must be in scope when using JSX`**
  
  _The solution_:

  Update the extends to look like below:

  ````
  module.exports = {
    extends: [
      'plugin:react/recommended',
      'plugin:react/jsx-runtime',
    ]
  }
  ````

- **`'React' is defined but never used`**

  _The solution_: 
    
  Install the following moduleÂ `npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-react`. 'plugin:react/recommended is already added ino extends in the .eslintrc.js file.
    
- **`'` can be escaped with `&apos;`, `&lsquo;`, `&#39;`, `&rsquo;`**. 
  
  _The solution_:

  Take the text inside template literals: `{`${explorer?.owner}'s posts:`}`
  
  Click [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73271987/19259-error-can-be-escaped-with-apos-lsquo-39-rsquo-r) to come to the source.

- **`Do not pass children as props. Instead, nest children between the opening and closing tags`**
  
  _The solution_:

  As the code is based on the code provided by Code Institute I chose to ignore that by disable the line: `eslint-disable-next-line`
